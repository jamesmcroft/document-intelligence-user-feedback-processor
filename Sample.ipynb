    "# Azure Document Intelligence Custom Template User Feedback Loop Experiment\n",
    "\n",
    "This experiment demonstrates how to replicate the functionality of the [Azure AI Document Intelligence](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-GB/azure/ai-services/document-intelligence/overview) Studio custom model training process. The aim is to showcase how you may implement a user feedback loop for improving the quality of document processing results. The feedback mechanism can be implemented to allow developers of custom models in Azure AI Document Intelligence to collect feedback from users to improve the model's performance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook provides an interactive user feedback experience, enabling a user to analyze a document using a trained model, visualize the analysis results overlaid on the document, and correct any incorrectly identified or missing fields. This implementation could be replicated in any client application using your chosen framework's capabilities, such as React, Angular, or Vue.js.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: This notebook provides _one_ potential approach to user interaction, and can be interpreted in many ways based on your use case.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Pre-requisites\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: Before continuing, please ensure that the [`Setup-Environment.ps1`](./Setup-Environment.ps1) script has been run to deploy the required infrastructure to Azure. This includes the Azure AI Document Intelligence resource and the Azure Storage account for creating a custom model.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook uses [Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) to ensure that all the required dependencies are available in a consistent local development environment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following are required to run this notebook:\n",
    "\n",
    "- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)\n",

    "- [Remote - Containers extension for Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers)\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Note**: The Dev Container is pre-configured with the required dependencies and extensions. You can run this notebook outside of a Dev Container, but you will need to manually install the required dependencies including Poppler, Tesseract, and OpenCV.\n",
    "\n",
    "The Dev Container will include the following dependencies by default:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Debian 11 (Bullseye) base image\n",
    "- Python 3.12\n",
    "  - azure-ai-formrecognizer - for interacting with the Azure AI Document Intelligence service\n",
    "  - azure-core - for interacting with the Azure AI Document Intelligence service\n",
    "  - ipycanvas - for rendering the document and allowing the user to draw over it\n",
    "  - ipykernel - for running the notebook\n",
    "  - notebook - for running the notebook\n",
    "  - opencv-python-headless - for image processing\n",
    "  - pdf2image - for converting PDFs to images\n",
    "  - pytesseract - for performing OCR on the document\n",
    "- Poppler - used by pdf2image to convert PDFs to images\n",
